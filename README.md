To create a gif you just need to run times_tables/times_tables.pde which outputs all frames as png files.
Those need to be converted to single gif files with the times_tables/output/convert.bat.
After that all the gif files can be stitched together to one file with times_tables/output/gif.bat.

There are a lot of tweaks you can do to the design in the pde.
The bat files are very simple and can easily be replicated with bash if you need to.
